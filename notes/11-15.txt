Bridges are filters

Bridge table
    - self learning
    - spanning tree

Wirelesss
    - two nodes
    - infrasstructure, ad hoc

Challenges
    - signal strength, interference, multipath distortion, mobility

Hidden terminal probelm


Wi-fi
-----
Wired fidelity
802.11a, b, g, n, ac, etc...

    - a = 11 Mbs
    - g = 54 Mbs
    - a = 54 Mbs
    - n = 450 Mbs
    - ac = 1300 Mbs

All of the above use CSMA/CA
     - CA == collision avoidance

    - why not CD?
        -- can't listen when transmitting

    - goal is to avoid collisions


CSMA/CA
-------
(1) if sense channel idle for DIFS then
        transmit entire frame
(2) if sense channel busy then
        start random backoff time
        timer counts down while channel is idle
        transmit when time expires
        if no ACK, increasse backoff time then (2)
(3) if frame received OK
        return ACK after SIFS


Router to Host
--------------
1) Router ARPr for host addr
2) Router sends ethernet frame with
    - DA = host MAC address
    - SA = router port MAC address
3) AP receives ethernet frame and converts to 802.11
    - Addr1 = host MAC addr
    - Addr2 = AP MAC addr
    - Addr3 = Router MAC addr


Host to AP
----------
Addr1 = AP MAC
Addr2 = Host MAC
Addr3 = Router MAC


AP to Router
------------
DA = router MAC
SA = host MAC


Wifi Cont.
----------
Medium distance, high speed
    - basically an ethernet replacement


Bluetooth
---------
Short distance, high speed
    - meant to be a bus replacement


Zigbee
------
short distance, low data rate
    - control
    - power meters, light switches, etc.


Sensor networks
---------------
disposable wireless device
    - sensor + cpu/mem + transceiver


Cellular communications
-----------------------
telephony anywhere, anytime

two flavors
    - GSM
        -- TDM
    - CDMA
        -- FDM

1G
    - analog voice
2G
    - voice + slow data
3G
    - faster 2G
4G
    - faster 3G
5G
    - faster 4G


Wireless safety
---------------
Microwaves
    - heats tissue
    - dna changes?
    - cancer?

Government defined
    - specific absorbtion rate (SAR)
        -- 1.6 W/kg
