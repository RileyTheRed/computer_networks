Two Network Types:

    - Curcuit Switched:
        -- dedicated physical connection
            --- more consistent performance, no loss due to over sharing
            ex: "bell heads"
    
    - Packet Switched:
        -- shared physical connection
        -- chunks of data called packets
            --- better utilization of resources
            ex: "net heads"



A concept of functional layers, each layer handles a specific task

 ** see papers ** 


OSI Model:

    7 - Application - Provides access to user applications
    6 - Presentation - Provides data independence
    5 - Session - Manages end-to-end connections
    4 - Transport - Provides reliable end-to-end data trasnport
    3 - Network - Maintains point-to-point connections
    2 - Data Link - Provides reliable point-to-point data transport
        -- Error Detection

    1 - Physical - Transmission of bit stream
        -- EE layer


Networks: Has to do with layers 4,3,and 2
OS: has to do with layers 7,5,and 6



Definitions!

    Protocol - Complete set of rules for information exchange between same
               layers at different sites

    Interface - Complete set of rules for information exchange between adjacent
                layers at the same site

    Open Concept - The ability of any two systems conforming to the reference
                   model and associated standards to connect.

    Layering Concept - Each layer performs unique and specific tasks
                       Knowledge of adjacent layers only
                       Uses services of the layer below
                       Provides functions to the layers above
                       Layer service is independent of implementation

    

Internet Model (Stack Model):

    This is the model that we will be using for the course

    5 - Application
        -- HTTP

    4 - Transport
        -- TCP, UDP

    3 - Network
        -- IP

    2 - Link
    1 - Physical


    Layers 1 and 2 are exemplified by Wifi and Ethernet
        -- Wifi ( 802.11 )
        -- Ethernet ( 802.3 )


Standards Organizations:

    - The first standards that came about were weights and measures

    - IEEE 802
        -- standardized local network communications
    - ISO
    - ITU
        -- International Telegraphy Union (phone standards)
        -- very closed, also French :/
    - IETF  **
        -- Internet Engineering Task Force
        -- Important to us
        -- Open! Anyone can go to meetings and stuff
        -- as standards are development and formatted, they are available online

    Standards are great for discouraging monopolies, but they hold back tech
    inovations. It also ensures a large market (good thing!)
