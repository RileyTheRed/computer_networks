History

- Communications is a human urge
    ex: drum signals, fire, smoke

- Ancient Greeks
    ex: signal fires, couriers (marathon)

- Napoleonic France
    ex: optical telegraph

- Mid-18002
    ex: telegraph
    - wire accross the atlantic in 1866
    (victorian internet)

- 1870 - > 1970
    ex: telephone

- 1970 -> now
    ex: internet, packet switching



What are the challenges with making all this communication faster/efficient?


- Fundamental Measures:
    1: throughput
    2: delay
    3: loss
    4: cost
    5: mobility
    6: robustness
    7: secrecy
    8: differentiated services


Cost comes in two forms:
    - capital expense
        ex: hardware, copper
    - operational expense
        ex: power, employees


What are the challenges???
    - Higher throughput
    - lower delay/loss/cost
    - higher mobility/robustness/secrecy


Two fields of Study:
    1: information theory - What is the theoretical max throughput for a
        channel?

    2: Coding Theory: How do I achieve max throughput?


Communication Tasks:
    - data formatting
    - error detection + recovery
    - addressing
    - routing
    - flow control
    - system management
    - security
    - quality of service
