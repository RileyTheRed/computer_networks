REVIEW
------

Sockets - interface between app. and trans. layers

transport layer - end-2-end data trasnfer




- All end-nodes (hosts) have all 5 layers
- All intermediate nodes have layer 1,2,3


LAYER 4
-------

- Services
    1) Multiplexing/demultiplexing
    2) reliable data transport
    3) congestion control
    

Multiplex/demultiplex
    - multiple applicatoons
        -- port numbers
            - in our application, it becomes a socket
                -- each process has unique


Reliable Data Transport
    - A game!
        -- design a protocol to reliably deliver 4x5 cards across the room
        -- cards can get
            - lost
            - out-of-order
            - altered
            - duplicates

        -- Checksum
            - # letters on a card
        -- sequence #

Protocol Criteria
    - Correct
    - High throughput
    - Simple to implement
        -- You have to be able to describe it



Finite State Machine (FSM)
--------------------------
State
Transition
    - has an event
    - has an action


Events
    - receive something
    - timer expires
    - counter hits some value
Actions
    - send something
    - start a timer
    - increment a counter


Example:
If a fully power-up system has been inactive for a period of time, it goes to
sleep. When asleep if it receives a special wake-up packet, it wakes up.
Activity is user input
