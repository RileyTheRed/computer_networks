CRC
    - see notes
Ssharing a channel
    - 4 ways
        -- FDM, TDM, contention, token passing
        -- TDM
            - dedicated slots, e.g., T1 = 1.544 Mb/s
LAN
    - defintion
    - categories
        -- media, topology, access control
    - direct wired -> star wired
        -- star wired is standardized
ALOHA
    - norm abramson
        -- surfer
    - first LAN - wireless packet radio
    - unslotted U = %18
    - slotted = %30


Ethernet
--------
Topology
    - 10Base5
        -- 10 Mb/s
        -- direct wired coax
        -- 500 meters
    - 10Base2
        -- ran on thinner coax
        -- still direct wired
        -- 200 meters
    - 10BaseT
        -- star wired
        -- UTP (unshielded twisted pair?)
            - phone cabling
        -- had hub or repeater
            - bus or collision domain
    - 100BaseT
    - 1000BaseT
    - 10G
        -- useful for datacenters
    - 40G-100G
        -- useful for datacenters

CSMA/CD
    - carrier sense multiple acess / collision detection

    - (1) if medium is idle then transmit
    - (2) if medium is busy then wait until idle and then transmit
    - (3) if detect collision then transmit a brief jam signal, stop
      transmition, and wait a random period of time then (1)

BEB
    - binary exponential backoff

    - while attempts < backoff_limit
        k := Min(attempts, 10)
        r := Rand(0, 2^k)
        delay := r * slot_time

    - backoff_limit = 16
    - each collision attempts in incremented
    - set to zero on successful transmission

Collisions
    - see notes

Token Ring
    - IEEE 802.5
    - IBM
    - see notes for drawing

    - token circulates
    - station that wants to transmit changes token from free to busy and appends
      frame
    - sender strips frame and releases token
        -- for fairness
    - deterministic

Bridging
--------
Layer 2
Forwards only those frames not addressed to local stations
    - MAC address
Basically a traffic filter

Why a bridge?
    1) performance
        - the BIG deal
    2) reliability
    3) security
    4) politics
