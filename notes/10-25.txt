Review
------
Route selection
    - centralized, decentralized
Criteria
    - fast, simple, low overhead, not create loops, stable, converges

Instability can be a big issue
    - oscillation, route flapping

Two flavors
    - link-state
        -- dijkstra, ospf
    - distance-vector
        -- bellman-ford, RIP

Types of networks
    - interior
        -- aka autonomous
    - exterior

Dijkstra's Algorithm
    - find the shortest path from a given node to all other nodes by developing
      paths in order of increasing path lengths

Bellman-ford
    - exchange routing tables neighbor-to-neighbor. use this information to
      develop least cost routes

IP Addr
-------
IP is the narrow waist of the internet. The network layer has one protocol
choice: IP.

IPv4
    - Header
        -- Version
            - 4 or 6
        -- length
            - length of the header (in words)
        -- type of service
            - not used?
        -- total length
            - packet length
        -- identifier
            - unique value used to identify the datagram
        -- flags
            - fragmentation allowed?
        -- offset
            - fragment offset
        -- ttl
            - # router hops
        -- protocol
            - next layer
        -- header checksum
        -- source + destination ip addresses
            - 32 bits

IP addresses are hierarchical
    - net_id.host_id
    - router tables only know the net_id

Historically, we had address classes:
    - class A
        -- see notes
    - class B
        -- see notes
    - class C
        -- see notes
    - class D

    - Wasteful of addresses

ICANN
    - RFC 2050

Classless Interdomain Routing (CIDR)
    - a.b.c.d/x
        -- x == # bits in net_id
            - net_id == subnet
            - for routing we match the longest prefix

Lease an IP address
    - DHCP
        -- dynamic host config protocol
        -- RFC 2131
    - NAT
