CRACKING THE CODING INTERVIEW
-----------------------------
Must have if I want to go work for any of the big tech companies



Review
------
    - Private
        -- Symmetric
        -- Shared secret
    - Public
        -- Can talk privately with someone I have NOT met


    - Elements of a crypto-system
        -- Algorithm
        -- Key
        -- Plaintext
        -- Cyphertext



Authentication
--------------
(See notes)



Digital Signatures
------------------
Verify sender
Verify message integrity



Message integrity with a hash
-----------------------------
Hash?

    - String -> hash -> signature (smaller than string)

    - Integrity
        -- Can verify sender
        -- Can verify message not changed

What we want:
    - no two strings hash to same value
    - Mathematically possible for two strings to get same hash
        -- computationally infeasable 


Firewall
--------
    - Packet filter

    - Stateless
        -- every packet handled stand alone
    - Stateful
        -- knowledge of previous packets
            - Circuit level
                -- terminates TCP connections

    - Get through a firewall
        -- Find bug in rules
        -- Crash the box and the firewall rules dont apply
        -- Misuse a port number
