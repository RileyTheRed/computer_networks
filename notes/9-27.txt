For what environment does SAW give poor performance?
    - Large RTT
How to fix poor performance?
    - See notes for the information for sending a lot of packets.


Transport Layer Challenges
--------------------------
How do we know the receiver is there?
What should timeout be?
What rate to start sending?


TCP Flags
---------
    - URG
    - ACK
        -- An acknowledgement
    - PSH
    - RST
        -- Reset
        -- Great Firewall of China, other firewalls can use this to close your
           request for some connection
    - SYN
        -- Synchronize
    - FIN
        -- Last packet


(Notes for connection diagram)

SYN-Attack (SYN-Flooding)
    - Bad guy keeps sending syn's, server continuously allocates memory until
      no more memory is left

    - SYN-cookies fix this attack


RTO
---
Retransmission Timeout

    - Local RTO = RTT + a smidgen

The Old Way
==========
SRTT = Smooth RTT
                                        ** RTT SAMPLE **
    - SRTT(k + 1) = alpha * SRTT(k) + (1 - alpha)*RTT(k+1)
    - RTO(k+1) = beta*SRTT(k+1)

    alpha = 1/2
    beta = 2

    - Stop sampling on retransmission
    - Doubling RTO for each resend


The New Way
===========
    - SRTT(k+1) = (1-g)*SRTT(k) + g*RTT(k+1)
    - SERR(k+1) = RTT(k+1) - SRTT(k)
    - SDEV(k+1) = (l=h)*SDEV(k) + h*|SERR(k+1)|
    - RTO(k+1) = SRTT(k+1) + f*SDEV(k+1)

    g = 1/8
    h = 1/4
    f = 4


TCP Response to Congestion
--------------------------
TCP must reduce transmit rate when congestion occurs.
Time-out is implicit detection of congestion.

How do deal with this as a sender?
    - Reduce window size
        -- Multiplicative decrease
        -- Additive increase

    - Lots of details and nuances
    - Not a lot of verisons of TCP, but where they are different is how the
      handle window sizes


UDP IN FIVE MINUTES
-------------------
User Datagram Protocol.
Best Effort.
