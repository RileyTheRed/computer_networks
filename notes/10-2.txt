Review From Last Class
----------------------
    - Sample on non retransmits
    - Double RTO on timeout
        -- Avoids a loop of double sending

    - Congestion Control
        -- Use window size to modulate sending rate
        -- Implicit detection of loss

        -- Slow start
        -- Congestion avoidance
        -- Sawtooth



Congestion Control
------------------
Congestion occurs because of sharing, that is the essence of packet switched
networks.

Goals:
    - Minimize packet loss
    - Maintain with high probability agreed-upon QoS
    - Minimize probability that one user can monoploize
    - Simple
    - Create minimal additional traffic
    - Limit spread of congestion
    
    In Short:
        High Throughput
        Low Delay
        Fair


Detecting Congestion
--------------------
    - Implicit
        -- Time-out implies packet loss implies congestion
            --- e.g., TCP
    - Explicit
        -- Control message back to sender

Control Sending Rate
--------------------
    - Change window size
    - Rate control


Fairness
--------
    - Trade-off is throughput vs. fair

    - Proportional
        
    - Max-Min


    - Example:
        Have 12 cards to allocate. Three people want something.
            A wants 2
            B wants 6
            C wants 20

        Proportionally:
            A = (2 / (2 + 6 + 20)) * 12 = 6/7
            B = (6 / (2 + 6 + 20)) * 12 = 18/7
            C = (20 / (2 + 6 + 20)) * 12 = 60/7

            - Cheating benefits me

        Max-Min:
            
            First Round:
                Give A 4
                    - 2 left over, A is happy
                Give B 4
                Give C 4

            Second Round:
                A = 2
                B = 4 + 1 = 5
                C = 4 + 1 = 5

            - Cheating does not benefit me


Max-Min:
    - Resources allocates is order of increasing demand
        (Spread out equally)
    - No source gets more than its demand
    * Sources with unsatisfied demand get an equal share of resource




Security
--------
Jumping to chapter 8

    - What is network security?
        1) confidentiality
            -- only sender and receiver understand message
        2) Authentication
            -- sender, receiver want to confirm identity
        3) Message Integrity
            -- message not altered
        4) Availability + Access
            -- services need to be accessible
