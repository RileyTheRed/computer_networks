Datagram
    - packets can take different paths, can arrive out of order, find shorter
      path, etc

Virtual Circuit
    - a single static route

How to select routes?
    - centralized method
        -- link state
            - all the routers know the link status of other routers
    - decentralized (distributed) method
        -- distance vector
            - routers exchange routing tables with each other

When selecting a route, we need to take into account:
    - the path
        -- {a, b, c}
    - the path cost
        -- {0, 1, 3}

        (A -> B -> C)

Criteria of a good algorithm?
    - converge to optimal solution
    - fast
    - simple
    - stable
    - generate low network traffic
    - does not create loops


What algorithms do we use for the two methods to select a route?
    - centralized
        -- dijsktra
            - OSPF: open shortest path first
                -- currently used in internet
    - distributed
        -- bellman ford
            - RIP: routing information protocol
                -- early arpanet


Two classes of routing protocols:
    - interior
        -- used within a (local) network
    - exterior
        -- used outside a (local) network (think internet)
