Protocol
--------
Complete set of rules for info exchange between same level layers layers at
different sites

A protocol is to a network as a program is to a computer
    - implement algorithms for networks

Five Elements
    1) Service to be provided
    2) Assumptions about the environment

Email
Web
File Sharing
Remote Login
Multiplayer games
Texting
Netflix

Process - A running program
    - User interface
    - Network Interface

HTTP

HTTP 1.0
HTTP 1.1
    - IETF standard

    - RFC 1945
    - RFC 2068
        -- each coincide with http 1.0 and 1.1, respectively 

Requests

HTTP is 100 Words or less!
- The hypertext transfer protocol is an application layer protocol. HTTP is used
  to transfer web content between a browser application and an HTTP server. All
web content is identified by a URL. HTTP is a request-response protocol that
uses TCP for assured delivery. HTTP uses ASCII encoded headers. The HTTP GET
command retrieves HTML files and other objects. The GET header includes the URL
of the object and other optimal fields such as capability, language, and so on.
The response includes a response header with a code (code 200 is OK and 400 is
page not found). Other commands include POST and HEAD.
