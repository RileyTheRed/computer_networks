Goals of the Internet:
    
    - Clark:
        -- Key architect of the internet
    
    - Top Level Goal
        -- To develop an effective method for multiplexed utilization of
           existing networks
            --- Packets!!

        
    - Second Level Goals (Doesnt really include security)
        1) Communications must continue despite loss of networks or gateways
        2) Multiple types of communication service
        3) Accomodate variety of networks
        4) Distributed management 
        5) Cost effective
        6) Host attachment is not difficult
        7) Resources used must be accountable


Networks Under Attack

    - Internet is "mission critical" for economy
        -- Internet goes down, we go home
    - Bad guys
        -- Vandals
        -- Criminals 
        -- Foreign entities
        

        - What can they do?
            -- Sniff packets
            -- Put malware on your host
            -- Denial of service
            -- Masquerade as you

Security is the probably the biggest problem/challenge of the internet today



Quality of Service
    - Network provisioning 
    - Design a network to provide a specific level of service
        -- throughput
        -- delay
        -- loss
        -- "up" time

    - Service level agreement (SLA)
        -- per connection
        -- per month

    - Different applications have different requirements
        -- data
            - high throughput
            - variable delay
            - some loss
        -- voice
            - some loss
            - fixed delay
            - low throughput
        -- remote control
            - low throughput
            - low delay
            - no loss

    - Implementation
        1) Admission control
        2) Packet classification
            - voice/data/etc
        3) Traffic shaping/scheduling
