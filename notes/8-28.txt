What is the Internet?
--------------------

Physical View
    - billions of devices
    - links
        -- copper
        -- fiber
        -- wireless

Serivce View
    - Distributed Applications
        -- Remote login
        -- Email
        -- File sharing
        -- Web
        -- Voice
        -- Many others!

    Most serveices are based off of a:
        - Client/server model
            -- client request services
            -- server provides services

Edge View
    - Connection Oriented (TCP)
        -- guaranteed delivery of data
            (sometimes updates are not real time)
    - Connectionless (UDP)
        -- no guarantee 
            (this serves real time updates)

Core View
    - Packet-switching
        -- shared path
        -- data sent in blocks

Packet View
    - Datagram
        -- path is not reserved
        -- more robust
    - Virtual Circuit
        -- reserved path
        -- guarantees that packets arrive in order
        -- less robust

Media View
    - Copper
        -- un-shielded
        -- coax
    - Fiber
        -- multimode
        -- singlemode
        -- "Infinite" Bandwidth
        -- Costly
        -- No lightning damage
        -- very hard to tap



Delay + Loss
------------

Four Factors for Delay
    1) Processing 
        - "code path" to write and read headers
    2) Transmission
        - time it takes to push the packet on the wire
        - Txnit = L / R
            -- L = length of packet
            -- R = bandwidth in bits/sec
    3) Propagation
        - Distance, speed of light
            -- 1ft ~ 1ns
            -- 1mile ~ 5 micro sec
            -- Accross USA ~ 15ms
        - Only thing to do to cut down on prop. delay is to close distance
    4) Queueing
        - buffering in nodes
            -- difficult to determine


Tools
    - Ping
    - Trace Route

Loss
    Two Cause:
        1) Electrical Noise
        2) Buffer Overflow
            - Predominant



Internet History
