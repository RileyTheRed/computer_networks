RDT in book (pages 206-218)

What bad things could happen to the packet?
    - Packet is lost
    - Packet is corrupted
        -- detected
        -- undetected
    - Out of order delivery
    - Duplicated


Which of the above is helped with sequence numbers?
    - Packet is lost

    - Without sequence #, receiver cannot know if a received packet is a
      duplicate (e.g., due to lost ACK)


What do we do with our newly created protocol? Analize it!

Utilization Analysis
--------------------

U = t-useful / (t-useful + t-overhead)


(See notes)
This protocol isnt all that great. So we create a new one, which can have
multiple outstanding packets for an ACK.

This new protocol is called a sliding window protocol (SW)

But what happens if there is some loss? 
    - prob(packet loss) > 0

    - Given bit error rate, we can derive rate of packet loss



Transport Later Challenges
--------------------------
How do we know receiver is there?
    - Connection semantic
What should time-out be set to?
    - Too short
    - Too long

    - Sample average RTT and set to about that average

What rate to start transmitting?
    - Not too slow, not too fast
    - Start small, and if you keep getting ACKs then increase window size
