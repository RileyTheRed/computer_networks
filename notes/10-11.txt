Review
------
Firewalls
    - packet filter
        -- stateless
        -- stateful

How to get through?
    - Use a port for nefarious access, crash firewall.



Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
--------------------------------
    - Determine if attack has/is occurred/occurring
    - Detect
        -- Signature
            - Generates an alert
        -- Anomaly

    - Port scan attacker systematically checks connections to look for open
      ports

Anomaly Detection
-----------------
    - Login to boss account at 3am


Alerts
------
    - True positive
    - False positive
    - True negative
    - False negative

    - SNORT (?)
    - BRO (?)


Denial of Service (DoS)
-----------------------
    - Making a resource unavailable
        -- overload the system and crash it
    - Many senders ... one attackee
    - Botnet
        -- many hosts, used to send packets at high rate of speed

    - Cascading failures


SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)
--------------------------
    - A means of securing TCP connections
    - HTTPS
    - (See book, I kind of already know this)


VPN (Virtual Private Network)
-----------------------------
    - Provide private communication on a public network
    - Basics
        -- Tunneling
            - Multihop path looks like one hop
        -- Authentication
        -- Access Control
        -- Data Security

    - VPN software as gateways



Project
--------
    - Hidden web server
    - Port knocking to open hidden server
        -- NO PLAYBACK
    - No SSL
    - No Firewall


Networking Layer (Layer 3)
--------------------------
    - All nodes have layers 1 to 3
    - End nodes also have layers 4 and 5

    - The primary function of a network is to deliver packets from a sender to a
      receiver
        -- Key is a path or route

    - Key functions
        -- Forwarding of packets
            - How to choose port to forward to? (physical port)
        -- Routing
            - How to choose a path?

    - Two Flavors
        -- Datagram
            - each packet is routed individually
            - connection exists at layer 4 (not 3)
            - out-of-order can happen
            - (Netheads)
        -- Virtual Circuit
            - establish a path at layer 3
                -- connection
            - all packets flow over same path
            - intermediate nodes maintain connection state
            - can have mission control (can deny connections)
            - (Bellheads)

    - What is the best route from A to B?
        -- Least hops
            - Static
        -- Fastest links
            - Static
        -- Least congestion
        -- Lowest delay
        -- Most secure
            - Static

        -- All of the above are notions of a metric "least cost"

    - How select route?
        -- Centralized
        -- Distributed
