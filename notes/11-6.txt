L2 serivices
    - framing
    - link access
    - error detection
    - others

Serial comm
    - start/stop bits
    - parity bit

Analysis
    - see last weeks notes for the formulas for probablitiy of errors
    - assume that:
        -- bit errors are iid(?) (independent)
        -- start/stop bits are not in error

Framing
    - SDEL
    - EDEL


CRC
---
For k-bit message, add n-bit CRC
Frame T has k+n bits

CRC is such that a frame T is evenly divisible by generator polynomial P
    - if this condition holds, we have either:
        -- no errors
        -- no detectable errors

T = (n + k) bit frame
M = k-bit message
F = n-bit CRC
P = (n + 1) bit generator polynomial

T = 2^n * M + F
F = remainder((2^n * M)/P)

For the two formulas above, lets keep in mind modulo-2 arithmatic
    - XOR is importnant

How to select P?
    - we can hire an intelligent mathemetician!

P is selected so that we can detect:
    - all single-bit errors
    - all double bit errors
    - any odd # errors
    - any burst error less than n-bits
    - many burst errors more than n-bits

Example:
    - see notes


Sharing a channel
-----------------
Four ways
    1) FDM
        - frequency division multiplexing
        - EE magic

    2) TDM
        - time division multiplexing
        - channel is partitioned into slots
        - a frame has N slots
            -- slots are reserved for a user

        - Example:
            -- T1 = 1.544 Mb/s
            -- || 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  |...|
            -- first slot is 1 bit, all others are 8 bit slots
            -- 8000 frames per second
            -- 8000 * (24 * 8 + 1) = 1.544 Mb

    3) Contention
        - CSMA/CD
            -- carrier sense multiple access / collision detection
        - Steps
            -- listen, if idle talk
            -- if collide, backoff and try again later

    4) Token passing
        - potentially more overhead
        - steps
            -- receive a token, then talk
            -- pass token to next station when done talking


Local Area Network (LAN)
------------------------
Data network optimized for a medium sized area
    - 10's to 100's of stations
    - 100's to 1000's of meters

Owned and operated by a single organization

Basically, a building-scale network

Categories
    - media
        -- copper, fiber, wireless
    - topology
        -- direct, star
    - medium access control
        -- contention, token passing


LAN Topology
------------
See notes

Trade-offs
    - scaling
    - standard
        -- EIA 568 something (star wired standard)
            - maximum distance from wiring closet to station is 100 meters


First LAN: ALOHA
----------------
Norm Abramson came up with it
Hawaii

How to connect main campus to branch campus?
    - mainframe

He created packet radio
To use packet access, he needed a:
    - protocol

Along comes ALOHA
    - additive links on-line hawaii area

ALOHA is very simple:
    - put data in fixed length a[packet, send it
    - if receive an ACK it was received, else send it again later
    - Utilization = 18%

SLOTED ALOHA
    - Utilization = 36%
