Review
------
NAT
IPv6
    - 128 bit address
    - flowspec
    - unicast, multicast, anycast
Multicast
    - reduce bottleneck
    - routers duplicate packets
ARP
    - ARP cache IP addr - MAC addr
    - L2 broadcast
Router Internals
    - Ports
    - routing table
        - routing protocol
    - label swapping
    - port swapping


Layer 2
-------
Provides point-to-point communications
LANs
    - local area network
    - IEEE 802.3 == ethernet
    - IEEE 802;11 == wifi

Services
    - framing
        -- encapsulation of layer 3 packet
    - link access
        -- sharing a medium
    - error detection
    - error correction
    - flow control

The most important services we will be focusing on are framing, link access, and
error detection.

Adapter - layer 1, 2
    - NIC
        -- network interface controller


Framing
-------
Where does my data begin and end?

Serial
    - define a start and stop bit
        -- start = 0
        -- stop = 1
        -- size of word is known

To delimit a frame (multiple words), we need to define the notion of a start and
stop delimiter. Physical layer detects the initial signal.


Error Detection
---------------
Parity
    - very simple form of checksum
    - parity bit appended to each word
    
Even parity
    - parity is 1 or 0 such that the sum of all bits is even
Odd parity
    - parity is 1 or 0 such that the sum of all bits is odd

Set parity bit at the sender
Check parity bit at receiver

Can detect single bit error
    -  can not detect double bit errors

* Can detect odd # bit errors
* Can not detect even # bit errors


Analysis
--------
Assume start, stop bits not corrupted
Assume Pb = P(bit error)
Assume bit errors are independent
N bits in word (including parity)

If my noise events are longer than the bit, and one bit is bad, then another bit
is almost certainly bad. (The assumptions above then are no reasonable)

P(no error in word) = (1 - Pb)^N
P(error in word) = 1 - (1 - Pb)^N
P(detectable error) = SUM(N, k = 1,3,...) (n chose k) * Pb^k * (1 - Pb)^(N-k)
    - binomial probability
P(undetectable errors) = same as detectable but k = 2,4,6,...


Frame Check Sequence
--------------------
SDEL ---------------------- FCS --- EDEL

FCS
    - layer 2 trailer
    - a cyclic redundancy code (CRC)
        -- better checksum
        -- detect more errors than checksum
