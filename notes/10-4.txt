------
Congestion Control
    - High throughput
    - Low delay
    - fair

Detect Congestion
    - Implicit
    - Explicit
        -- congestion notification bit

Control
    - Change window size in TCP
    - Rate control
        -- Discard eligible bits
    - Fairness
        -- proportional
        -- max-min


Network Security
----------------
    1) Confidentiality
    2) Authentication
    3) Message Integrity
    4) Availability


Confidential Communication

    - Cryptosystem
        -- private
            - Alice and bob have a shared secret
                -- Key distribution is the problem
        -- public
            (see below)

    - plain text
        -- unencrytped
    - cipher text
        -- encrypted

Cryptography 
    We ave:
        - Key
        - algorithm
        - plain text
        - cipher text

    - plain text + key -> algorithm -> cipher text
    - cipher text + key -> algorithm -> plain text

    - given the algorithm and cipher text, you can not derive the plain text or
      key

    - DES
        -- Data encryption standards
    - AES
        -- Advanced encryption standards
    - NIST
        -- National institute of standards and technology


Public Key Cryptosystem
-----------------------
(See notes)

    - Vulnerability
        -- How does Alice know that Kb+ is really from Bob?
            - Certificate Authority

Private key cryptosystems require less CPU horsepower to encrypt and decrypt
text.

Authentication
--------------
Goal: Alice wants to prove her identity to Bob

    - AP1.0
        -- Alice sends "M" to bob
            - M = "I am alice"
        
        -- Failure = Trudy can also send "I am Alice"

    - AP2.0
        -- Lets send a message AND her IP address

    - AP3.0
        -- Alice sends "m" to Bob
            - m = IP Address, Password, "I am alice"


    (Everything we have described so far is vulnerable to "playback attacks")

    
    - AP4.0
        -- (See notes)
