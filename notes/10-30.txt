Review
------
IPv4 header

Switch = input buffer - fabric - output buffer

3 generations of switches
    1) shared memory
    2) bus
    3) interconnect network

Line card - adapter with additional functionality

IPv4 address : ~4 billion addresses
    - net_id.host_id

CIDR - classless interdomain routing
DHCP - dynamic host config protocol
NAT


-------


NAT - RFC 3022
--------------
Network address translation
"Private IP addresses"

Insulates your home network from the internet. Your home netowrk has ONE
address, all devices in your home network then have NAT addesses : 10.0.0.1,
10.0.0.2, ....

Uses port numbers to map IP addresses


IPv6
----
128 bit addresses
    - 6 * 10^23 addresses per square meter of earth

Flow label
    - differentiated services

Three types of addresses
    - Unicast
        -- one to one
    - Anycast
        -- find next
    - Multicast
        -- one to many
        -- instead of having multiple physical lines from server to other hosts,
          the server sends infomation to a multicast network of routers;
        -- The router does all the resending and amplification
        -- application multicast
            -- clients repeat messagess


IPv4 to IPv6 transition
-----------------------
Cannot have a "flag day"

Dual stack
    - both servicing at once

Tunneling
    - we have to use IPv4, but when communicating between each other perhaps we
      can use IPv6? (tunnel IPv6 packet inside an IPv4 header)
    - If the routers between us are IPv4, but we are using IPv6, then we can
      embed our IPv6 packet inside the IPv4 packet

IoT is a driver for IPv6


ARP
---
Address resolution protocol

How do we associate an IP address with a layer-2 address (MAC address)?
(Ask someone for the written down example from class)
    - A wants to communicate with B
    - A brodcasts to all (B,C)
    - B replies
    - A now knows B's MAC address
